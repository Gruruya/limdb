0.3.0      support all of Nim's basic system types through generics
           -> breaks compatibility, must now provide types
 
           use writable memory-mapped mode for performance (Nim's static
           safety is enough, don't need C's costly runtime safety)

           add transaction block syntax `withTransaction`

           automatically chosing read and write in block syntax by
           default but allow override

           alternate ultra-short transaction block syntax `tx:`

           Support transactions spanning several databases by
           passing a tuple of databases to `initTransaction` or `withTransaction`

           Fix always using read/write transactions in database access procs

0.2.0      add getOrDefault, hasKeyOrPut, getOrPut, proc and take
